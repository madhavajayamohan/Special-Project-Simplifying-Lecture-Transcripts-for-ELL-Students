Professor: Today we’ll discuss iteration with lists and dictionaries. 
You should already be comfortable with for and while loops, so let’s apply them. 
Imagine we have a list of student scores. 
How do we find the average?

[Writes on board]

scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
total = 0
for score in scores:
    total += score
average = total / len(scores)

What’s the complexity of this approach? 
O(n). 
Now, let’s say we have a dictionary where keys are student names and values are scores.

[Writes on board]

students = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 80, "Charlie": 70}
for name, score in students.items():
    print(f"{name} scored {score}")

Think about cases where dictionaries are more efficient than lists. 
Where do we see an advantage in retrieval time?
