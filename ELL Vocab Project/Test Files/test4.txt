Let’s talk about debugging. 
When your code doesn’t work, don’t panic. 
We’ve all been there. 
Debugging is like finding a needle in a haystack—it can feel impossible at first, but there’s always a pattern. 
Start by checking what you can control. 
Are your variables doing what you expect? 
Print statements are your best friend at this stage.

Sometimes it feels like the bug is playing hide and seek with you. 
It shows up one minute, disappears the next. 
That’s totally normal. 
The key is not to reinvent the wheel—use the tools we’ve already covered. 
Read your error messages like a treasure map. 
They’re not just gibberish—they’re pointing you toward the problem.

Now, I know it can feel like you’re banging your head against the wall when nothing’s working. 
But trust me, getting through a tough bug teaches you more than an easy assignment ever will. 
Embrace the mess. 
Roll up your sleeves. 
This is where real programmers are made.
