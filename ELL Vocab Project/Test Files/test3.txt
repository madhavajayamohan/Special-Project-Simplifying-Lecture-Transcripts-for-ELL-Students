So today we’re diving into loops. 
If you’ve ever felt like you’re typing the same thing over and over, you’re probably barking up the wrong tree. 
That’s what loops are for—they let you automate repetition and avoid writing a bunch of redundant code. 
A for loop is your bread and butter when you know how many times something should happen. 
On the other hand, a while loop is more of a wildcard—you use it when the number of iterations is up in the air.

Now, don’t just throw in a loop and hope for the best. 
It’s easy to shoot yourself in the foot with an infinite loop if you forget to update your condition. 
That’s a rookie mistake, and it’ll cost you time during debugging. 
Think of your loop like a treadmill—you need to know how to stop it, or you’ll just keep running forever. 
Keep your conditions clear, test them early, and you’ll save yourself a world of hurt. 
Alright, let’s walk through a few examples together so you can get the hang of it.
