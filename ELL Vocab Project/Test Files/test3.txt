Professor: Alright, let’s start today by reviewing control flow. 
We've talked about conditionals before, but let’s take it a step further. 
Suppose we have a grading system where scores determine letter grades. 
We’ll write a function using if-elif-else statements.

 def get_grade(score):
     if score >= 90:
         return "A"
     elif score >= 80:
         return "B"
     elif score >= 70:
         return "C"
     elif score >= 60:
         return "D"
     else:
         return "F"

This is straightforward, but think about refactoring. 
The structure is fine, but notice that our conditions overlap. 
A cleaner way would be to start from the lowest case and move up. 
Also, let’s write some doctests for verification.

 def get_grade(score):
     """
     >>> get_grade(95)
     'A'
     >>> get_grade(85)
     'B'
     """
     return "F" if score < 60 else "D" if score < 70 else "C" if score < 80 else "B" if score < 90 else "A"

Refactored into a single expression. Now, who can tell me the trade-off here?
